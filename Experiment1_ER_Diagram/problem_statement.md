### Assumptions
1)Customer

Each customer has a unique Customer ID.

A customer can register for multiple events but must register separately for each event.

A customer may or may not take loans.

2)Event Registration

Acts as a bridge entity between Customer and Event (resolving many-to-many).

A registration must belong to one customer and one event.

Registration ID is unique for each record.

3)Event

Each event has a unique Event ID.

An event can have multiple customers registered.

An event can have multiple speakers, and each speaker can speak at multiple events.

4)Speaker

Each speaker has a unique Speaker ID.

A speaker may be linked to multiple events (many-to-many).

5)Loan

Each loan is uniquely identified by Loan ID.

A loan must be taken by one customer only.

Fine amount is applied only when the return date is later than the due date.
